Overview: The purpose of this application is to serve as a contact list for a user and allow him/her to store and view contacts. The user is able to Add, Delete (one or all), and Edit a contact. After the user makes a change to a contact, the updated state of the contact list is persisted to the database and reflected in the application.

The CSS folder contains mystyle.css, which determines the styles of various web components. The scripts folder contains verification.js, which is used to verify user input. It also contains app.js, which is used to connect to the database and perform all of the backend operations.
